I know for some of you this is not the first time 🥳🥳🥳, but it is still very important to do the exercises.
I am sure that in light of the changing situation in the world, the awareness of performing the exercises will be different.
This is a time when inner fears often float, so I guess on some days some of you will experience less pleasant moments. I have no doubt that maintaining a high level of awareness through performing the exercises will allow us to cope more easily🌸
Starting tonight, and every day, I will send the tasks to be completed the next day:
1. Personal exercise for writing in a notebook (have a colorful notebook that will smile at you).
2. Background on the Global Goals with addition of extra flavor.
The process requires loyalty to yourself and the group so commit to yourself and the group. *At the end of the practice, mark the number of the task/s (1-3 if you chose to do more than one task) and a flower or a heart emoji 🌻🌼🌸🌺🌹🌷💐🌾 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and for the next 18 days I will ask that this is all you will respond in the group*.
As always, anyone who needs support or explanations is welcome to send messages in private

Dear and sustaining friends 🥳🥳🥳
For those unfamiliar with this amazing journey named Challenge 18 - I will give you some information:
*This is an 18-day process, in which you are sent 1-3 short daily tasks inspired by the SDG's – sustainable development goals, and alongside them, a basic background on the goals. Each evening I will send the task of the next day, and you will have 24 hours to perform and confirm in the group you did. Your confirmation is the day/goal number and next to it one or more emojis, according to the task/s you have chosen to perform.*
For example: a heart in any color you choose or a 'green' environmental emoji of your choice. The score is according to the task number, so the maximum number accumulates from day to day.
For example:
Task 1 = one point and the mark is ❤️
Task 2 = two points and the mark is ❤️❤️ or an emoji chosen to represent the task
Task 3 = three points and the mark is ❤️❤️❤️ or an emoji chosen to represent the task.
For example, per the 1st day the maximum score is 6 hearts/flowers ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ - this is to the extent that you have chosen to perform all three tasks.
*The score is cumulative throughout the challenge, both in your individual journey and for the whole group, so the commitment of each and every one of you is to yourself and the whole group. good luck.*
Since we are a large group, it may be a bit challenging, but I am sure you will be able to contain it, because you are amazing and sustainable and that you really care about our planet and future generations 🌻🌼🌸🌺🌹🌷💐🌾


I encourage you to be committed to the process. Since I do not believe in top-down management here, I would be happy for those who do not connect to leave the group so that the overall energy remains of doing and growing
Thank you all for the opportunity to give you from the heart ❤️ Anyone who needs my help with something, please contact me in private

Hello everyone,
We start ..... I wish you all good luck 🌻 and that you will get the most out of this magical process.
*Lesson 1 - "Good begets Good" - On Spiritual Wealth and Human Wealth*
Today's task according to 1-3 levels of commitment – choose at least one of them, no matter what, the main thing is that you will feel comfortable and feel committed and connected to the process.
Day 1 Tasks:

1. *Watch the TED talk* - Poverty isn't a lack of character; it's a lack of cash | Rutger Bregman & reflect on what you saw.
https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k

2. *I have it - I have it* - a list of 18 things you already have in life.

3. *48 people* who have added value to your life - In the notebook you have chosen for the process, create a list of people who have added value to your life.
Write down everyone who is positive and who in your perception made you grow in some way.
The list must be complete according to the level of commitment you have chosen. It is important to remember that even people who seemingly did you "bad" made you grow. (While doing this, you will understand with yourself what the reason is for choosing them on the list). Proceed calmly, remembering the good things in each person, and what he / she has brought into your life.
Enjoy this activity!

		*Welcome to the first day of the 18 days of Sustainability & Leadership challenge - NO POVERTY.*
Did you know that almost half of the world's population lives in poverty worldwide – and that there are over a billion people - who still live on $ 1.25 a day or less, and the number has risen since the corona.
Should we blame those poor children who are born into such a reality?
& how those children will grow up knowing they will never be able to escape their poverty?
*What does this mean at all? What does this tell about our future? And what can be done?*
According to the SDG’s, the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN member states, goal number 1 is to reduce by half by 2030, the relative percentage of the poor in the world. And in your country? What goal did you commit to? What goal did we commit to? What employment opportunities are available to those of us living in poverty? What services and products exist for those of us living in poverty?
Since the outbreak of the corona plague, the economic situation of many citizens around the world has been so difficult that they are sometimes forced to give up one of the most basic human needs - food.
Eliminating poverty is not a task of charity, but an act of justice.
*What can you do now to fight poverty?*
*And now for spiritual wealth.*
We have compiled a list of people who have added value to our lives and focused on what we have in life. *What is spiritual wealth and what does it have to do with real wealth?* We can understand this when we think of our family, a family that supports each other when needed. When your brother or sister achieves success, the whole family celebrates. At the deepest spiritual level, we are connected not only to our parents and siblings but to the whole world, as we grow in this awareness, we live in oneness, celebrating the success of all. The human family.
Spend some time practicing unity, be present and be frequently interested in the lives of others when you talk to them. In your conversations, give your full attention and if you see someone in need, offer help.
Sharpening your observation of your surroundings and doing these things will help you develop a deeper understanding of true relationships.
The main thought for today:
*"Who is a rich man? He who is happy with his share".*

Task for the second day - ZERO HUNGER 💖 🌏 💖
Choose one of three tasks, no matter which one, the main thing is that you feel comfortable, committed and connected to the process. Challenge yourself to eat differently.
1. Watch the TED talk - What we're getting wrong in the fight to end hunger | Jasmine Crowe |& reflect on what you saw. Then, enter the telephone list of the group members and send to another group member of your thoughts from the video and in general in the context of poverty and hunger in your city/country and things to be done.
https://youtu.be/VasJyDmMafA

2. Avoid sweets - Choose not to eat sweets (Cakes, candies, soft drinks etc.) - from today until the end of the challenge, (at the end of the practice, mark the day number and 🍒 2 every day from now until the end of the challenge).

3. VegaNation Challenge yourself to eat vegan or vegetarian from today until the end of the challenge (at the end of the practice, mark the day number and 🌏 2 each day from now until the end of the challenge).
The main thing is that you maintain a better diet than you are used to. What do you say, can you?
After successfully completing the task until tomorrow at 20:00, type 🌏 or 🍒 2 in the group and each day from now until the end of the challenge.
Remember: the more you allow yourself in these processes, the more you will get for your personal growth.
Continue an evening full of Sustainability & Leadership 💫 🌏 💫

		*Welcome to the second day of the challenge - ZERO HUNGER*
We want more, consume more and throw away more, and not just food. What does this tell about us at all?
If we promote sustainable agriculture with modern technologies and fair distribution systems, we will be able to sustain the entire population of the world and make sure that no one will ever suffer from hunger.
According to the SDG’s, goal number 2 is - by 2030, to end hunger and ensure access for all human beings - especially the poor, children and people in vulnerable situations - to safe, nutritious and satisfying food throughout the world.
What is being done to stop the huge waste of food and make sure it reaches those who need it? Our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and ineffective care leave millions of people suffering from malnutrition.
*What can you change now in your food consumption habits? *
*One small change for you in your food consumption habits, one giant change for humanity.*
It is important to know that it is possible otherwise, that we can imagine and act for a better future - for a spiritual abundance that will replace the material and the extra waste.
The main thought for today: *"Who is a rich man? He who shares".*

		Welcome to the third day of the challenge - GOOD HEALTH & WELL BEING
"Health is a basic human right" (International Health Organization), and a key indicator of sustainable development.
Women all over the world still lack access to medical care related to sex and fertility; Billions of people are left without access to essential medicines, millions of adults and children will suffer from malnutrition this year, and some estimate that the amount of waste will triple this year. This will have serious health effects. In addition, thousands of new cases of the corona plague continue to happen every day, leading to political and economic instability, threatening the livelihoods of many of the world’s inhabitants. True, the Corona vaccine has not yet been found, development is under way, but think - who do you think will be the first to benefit from it?
What can you do now to become healthier, body, mind and spirit?
The main thought for today: a healthy mind in a healthy body in a healthy world

Choose one of three tasks, the main thing is that you feel comfortable, committed and connected to the process.

1. *Watch the TED talk* - Linda Cliatt-Wayman: How to fix a broken school? Lead fearlessly, love hard | & reflect on what you saw.

2. *Traveling books* - Write two ideas you read in a book on sustainability and send them to a friend in the challenge group. ❤️❤️ My recommendation to you is to read the fantasy book: 'The Journey to the Kingdom of Ludoland'.

3. *Thank you letter* - Write a letter to the teacher (teacher for life) that influenced you, in which you will express all your feelings, the feelings you have. Write everything you want. You are of course welcome to share with the group what you have written. Feel free to send the letter to the same teacher and watch the magic take place. Feel free to share here.

*Welcome to the fourth day of the challenge - QUALITY EDUCATION*
What if we teach our children how to think and not what to think?
What if we teach our children to question life, to question all?
What if we teach our children to realize their dreams?
Education is a basic human right, and is essential for achieving sustainable development. We can empower women, fight climate change, fight inequality, eradicate extreme poverty and more - only if we, the citizens, including the education system itself, commit to advancing education-related goals.
Goal #4 in the Global Goals states that by 2030, all boys and girls will complete primary and secondary education provided free of charge.
*What can you do now to assure quality education in your community?*
Everyone wants to be heard and no one is listening. The corona crisis has helped us understand that without the dominant involvement of society, which will influence decision-making politicians, there is no chance for humanity to survive on Earth. We can learn from crises, and especially from listening to others. Thus, the main thought for today is: *I listen to the other, I listen as I care.*

We continue the practice of appreciation 🤗🌱🌸🌷🌹 Day 5 - *Gender Equality* - Choose one of three, no matter what the main thing you will feel comfortable and feel committed and connected to the process.
Regarding today's task - *appreciation and not discrimination*

1. *Watch the TED talk* - Why Gender Equality Is Good for Everyone — Men Included | Michael Kimmel | TED Talks | & reflect on what you saw.
https://youtu.be/7n9IOH0NvyY

2. *Observation* - Think of a case where you yourself felt gendered, or a case of gender discrimination that you encountered in your life. What did you do then and what would you do differently today? Feel free to share with the group what you wrote.

3. *A Thank you` Letter* - Write a letter of thanks, a letter of appreciation, to a person of the opposite sex close to your heart that you think has hurt you at some point in your life.✳
Before writing a thank you letter, clear all the negative feelings about that person. If you still feel resentment, you can also write down all the negative feelings on a piece of paper and then burn or tear it.
The important thing is that when you write a letter of thanks / appreciation, you no longer feel resentment against that person.
Stop thinking who this person is. More than one person is conceivable, but we should only do the work with one.
The letter must be handwritten.
Good luck 🙏

*Welcome to the fifth day of the challenge - GENDER EQUALITY*
For many years there was a clear division between the roles of the man and the roles of the woman. The man was the provider, and the woman was in charge of the household. Each gender had fairly clear dress and behavior rules. The male was considered more than the female. In recent decades, the situation has been balancing. The law safeguards the rights of women and prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender, and many women reach senior positions in the economy. Yet the situation is far from optimal: women still earn less, are judged more on the basis of their appearance and suffer from harassment.
Gender equality is a basic human right that must not be violated, and the empowerment of women and girls is essential for strengthening economic growth, promoting social development and empowering the state as a whole.
*What do you do to fight gender inequality?*
Today we will focus on opportunities instead of obstacles. Today, we will focus on generosity instead of indifference, light instead of darkness, love instead of hatred, sustainability instead of chaos, abundance instead of lack, today we will focus on our choice to respect ourselves and others.
The main thought for today: *"We do not discriminate between people. We do not ask what a person's religion is, and what race he belongs to. He must be a human and for that we say enough"*. - Benjamin Zeev Herzl {From the book "Altneuland"}

Attach the exercise to day 6 - *clean water* - choose at least one of three tasks, feel comfortable, feel committed and connected to the process.
I wish all of you to open your eyes to a new day full of abundance like a flowing stream ☀☀☀☀☀

1. *Watch the TED talk* - A young scientist's quest for clean water | Deepika Kurup | & reflect on what you saw, then try to find water technologies developed in your country and share in the sharing group. 💟

2. *Write down your 5 flaws*, which you believe - stop or slow down your life flow, restrict or block you that do not allow you to get what you really want, whether it is material or not. 💟💟
Disadvantages you will want to improve / fix - and in their absence - everything will flow better. Try to concentrate and go as deep as possible. Look for the features and patterns that hold back the realization of your authentic and original potential. 💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟

3. Practice the *"Law of Giving and the Flow of Life"* by giving a small gift to everyone you meet, it should not be an expensive or monetary gift, the gift can be a smile, a flower, a compliment from the heart, a helping hand or a blessing in the heart and .. Stay open to accept any gift offered to you. 💟💟💟

*Welcome to the 6th day of the challenge - CLEAN WATER*
The water problem is a growing global problem. It is intertwined with global warming, desertification processes, population growth, and its result is a series of wars around water, mass migration, and political change.
Access to water and sanitation are basic human rights. Global Goal #6 speaks to the fact that by year 2030, everyone will have equal global access to safe and affordable drinking water.
The easiest way to get what you want is to *create cycles in the flow of abundance* and help others get what they want and need.
The more you give, the more you will receive and grow.

The thought for today: *"Today and every day - I give what I want to attract into my life."*

*Welcome to the seventh day of the challenge - CLEAN ENERGY*
Energy is life. In recent years there has been a huge increase in our energy consumption. Almost all of the energy we use comes from the earth – coal, gas and oil.
Today we have new and clean technologies at our disposal and they can divert development towards a green and sustainable energy production path. In general, implementing new energy solutions, as quickly as possible, is essential to reducing our excessive footprint and tackling climate change, one of the biggest threats to our survival.
*And now for energy in the spiritual dimension* - MC2 equals L love because energy in the highest dimension is love, and sustainability - means filling your life with love - not at the expense of future generations.
*Remember*: Before each choice you make, ask yourself, “How will this choice make me and those affected by my choices feel?“
Listen to your heart, hear the answer and give trust in the right choice - because energy in its highest dimension is pure love.
The main thought for today: *"Today I make great choices because they are made with pure love"*

*ECONOMIC GROWTH - Consciousness Abundance & Future Oriented Thinking*
Good evening to all ❤️ The 8th day is a founding and essential day when it comes to economic abundance 😇💸💸💸
Take advantage of the challenge to create in your life everything that is accurate and true in the field of abundance that you seek to magnetize to you ❤️
Choose at least one of the three tasks, the main thing is that you feel comfortable, committed and connected to the process. Note that Task 1 is from today until the end of the challenge.

1. *Watch the TED talk* - How the future of work is not “Jobs” | Rudy Karsan | TEDxCalgary | & reflect on what you saw.
https://youtu.be/sQNtu4kpd64

2. *Ting Ikigai* Want to find your Ikigai? Connect between different components of the three parts of the table to create a new value activity that you can work on. - Challenge yourself to ask 3 more friends the same question.

3. *Role play*: "Choose a character that connects to the kind of abundance you desire." From there, as dedicated actors you must begin to step into the shoes of the character and conduct your life as if you were the same character. How would you respond to conversations that come your way? What level of energy would you invest? What choices would she make?
Notice how we perceive ourselves as we conduct ourselves from this new perception and how those around us perceive us. How does it feel? Do things look different? The goal of the game is to teach us the extent to which our perception of reality has on the reality we experience.
From today until the end of the challenge you must practice the same character. *At the end of the practice, mark the day number and 💸 8 each day from now until the end of the challenge.*

*Welcome to the 8th day of 18 days of Sustainability & Leadership challenge*
*Goal 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth*
About half the world's population still lives on the equivalent of $2 a day. And in too many places, the fact that a person has a job does not guarantee his ability to escape poverty. And in your country? With the outbreak of the corona crisis, the unemployment rate quickly climbed up dramatically - most are workers who have been expelled from their daily jobs. What solutions are offered by government ministries?  What are the changes in work patterns that we are going to see?
On such days it is obligatory upon each and everyone of us to show creativity, unity and leadership, and to set a personal example and role model for our children and friends, to rebuild trust and to create a sense of security and abundance.
And now for *future-oriented thinking* - one of the most striking differences between successful people and those who are less successful, is not the amount of money they have, but future-oriented thinking, and their ability to act on time. When we, as one, imagine abundance and economic security - we can create anything we want.
*What if the solution to the economic crisis is - Universal Basic Income?*
*Imagine for a second* that the country provides you with Universal Basic Income (UBI), that will allow you economic security. An income that will alleviate the fear of existential worries and enable entrepreneurship and growth. Sounds imaginary? Once civil rights, the right to vote for women, the abolition of slavery and the establishment of the Jewish state - sounded utopian. Just like them, the idea of basic income sounds utopian on first reading and realistic and fair on second reading. Every citizen will receive a Universal Basic Income that allows for a dignified life, without having to worry about a shortage of food or shelter.
Sounds like Mission Impossible? Hard times require decisive action. We must join forces and find solutions.
And finally, an important note, especially in a time like this: Give what you want to receive. You must transmit to the conscious mind that you already have abundance in order to receive abundance. That is why donating and giving is extremely important. It's fascinating and it works miraculously. Maybe because in practice we are one.

The main thought for today: *"If you will it, it is no dream; and if you don't, a dream it is and a dream it will stay."* - Theodor Herzl. In other words, “when there is a will - there's a way”.

*Welcome to the ninth day of the challenge - Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure*
Every industry must innovate, and properly functioning immune infrastructures are the building blocks for any thriving community.
*Innovation and infrastructure are also on the spiritual level* - on the personal level, it is to break free from the shackles of the past, from those prejudices, customs and habits that limit your growth. Innovation is re-inventing yourself, recognizing opportunities in a time of crisis, connecting with yourself, spirit and soul.
*It's time to make life-changing decisions!* - How? Focus your intention about what you want and need.
*Remember* - what we notice and focus on, expands in our lives, and our intention will help the universe to support the desired outcome. Yes, with focus and intention, you can change your life and reflect your desires more accurately.
The main thought for today: *"Focus is a key & Imagination is your wings"*

*Welcome to the 10th day of the challenge - REDUCED INEQUALITIES*
*Today we will practice listening*
A stunning evening for everyone 💜💜💜 We are on the 10th day, which means that you have been in this process for 10 days and I am proud of each and every one of you.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
We have always been educated to think in dual format.  Us versus them. Right and left, rich and poor and even worse, such as national/local and global.  So, in the coming day we will practice listening 👂🏼👁️💜.
Ting - Ting - Ting - One of the most difficult tasks nowadays is how to channel our way through all the voices that demand our attention - the voices of the state, security, economy, family, media (Internet, TV, radio, newspapers, advertisements, etc.),  - and find the important for us and find ourselves among these.
To become a better person/leader, learn to listen first -”TING”.
The ancient Chinese word for listening, "TING", captures the spirit of listening:
Ears - to be attentive while the other speaks and not to think about what to have to say next.
Eyes - to be able to put ourselves in the place of the other and see things through his/her point of view.
Mind - the ability to understand the words of the other.
Heart - Only when we really care then we are really attentive.
Last word, if you need to remember one thing from this message, I want you to remember this: If you are experiencing difficulty, whatever it is, the solution is in dialogue, so immediately stop sending text messages, emailing and googling, and instead, internalize the principles of listening - TING聽
The next few days will be special and full of gifts from the universe. Learn to listen and look around and notice them
🌾🌿🌺🌈👂🏼👁️💜🌲🌳💐🌼
*Task for the tenth day of the challenge*
Today's lesson is to enjoy the day by listening genuinely.
Write in a notebook at least three ways you noticed things you had not noticed before (even small things).
Today's thought: *True listening is from the ears, the eyes and the heart.*
An amazing evening full of Sustainability, Leadership and true listening! 👂🏼👁️💜🦋🦄

*Goal 10 - REDUCED INEQUALITY*
Welcome to the tenth day of the 18 Days of Sustainability & Leadership of Ting Global.
Income and wealth inequality are severe and are becoming widespread throughout the world. 1% of the richest people in the world population currently control about 40% of the total global assets, while the poorest half hold only 1%. Simply put - most of the world's wealth is held by a very small group of people. What is the real meaning of these differences?
For countries to prosper, equality and growth must be the domain of the entire population. Regardless of gender, race, religion, belief or economic status. When we reach a reality in which each person is self-dependent and independent, then the whole world will be able to thrive - period.
In order to fight inequality between and within countries, we must promote inclusive business models that empower groups, which are on the margins of our communities.
Ask yourself "How can I help? How can I serve?"
To serve others with your 'gifts' is the highest expression of your destiny, when your creative expression matches the needs of those around you, abundance flows easily into your life, in exemplary divine order.
You can practice today, just constantly recognize your unique talents. Listen to your inner voice and ask yourself how you can use these 'gifts' to serve the world in the best way.
The main thought for today: *"I listen to my inner voice. The answers are inside me"* 👂🏼👁️💜

*Welcome to the eleventh day of the challenge - Cities and Sustainable Communities*
According to SDG 11 by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will live in cities, thus making cities vital in achieving a sustainable future for the world.
I have a dream to live in a sustainable city that allows for a life of happiness and living with dignity for all, inside and outside it.
I have a dream to live in a city that wisely and fairly uses the infrastructure, material, natural, human and social resources at its disposal.
I have a dream to live in a city that takes responsibility for its role in managing global ecosystems, and responsibility for its physical and cultural heritage and future generations.
And you, in what city do you dream to live in?

2. *Environmental cleanliness* - cleaning of waste in the environment near me. Just take a bag and clean, do not ask anyone to clean, the others will see and see how they will imitate you. Taking a ‘before and after’ photo will be great.

3. *I say “no” to disposable* - from today until the end of the challenge, do not use disposable - no drinking bottles, no disposable cups etc. *At the end of the practice, mark the day number and 🥥 12 each day from now until the end of the challenge.*

*Welcome to the Twelfth Day of the Challenge - RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION*
Mother Earth has provided us with an abundance of natural resources. Today we consume resources at a pace far beyond what the earth is capable of providing us. We must learn how to use and produce sustainable alternatives and repair the damage we have done to the environment and if not THIS IS THE END.
*Tell me please?* Isn't it disgusting for you to go to the beach and sit on a mixture of sand and plastic garbage?
It's time to really change our habits and demand from the manufacturing companies to take responsibility, it's time to march in the streets and raise a ”shout” and sign petitions because we deserve more.
Our world is being abused. We must start recycling, reducing, and producing as little garbage as possible. Because the garbage does not just disappear.  It is just being swept under the world carpet or spills into the sea.
It is obligatory upon each of us to take a decision and begin to reduce *our personal ecological footprint* in order to enable the renewal of natural resources on which our lives, the future of our children and biodiversity depend.
The main thought for today: *I stop to think (3) three times before I consume*

*Welcome to the thirteenth day of the challenge - Climate Action*
When I was a young student they talked about global warming. I remember coming out of the class scared and terrified that the end of the world was near. Yes, for over 30 years the scientific community has been warning of an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, while the global world population has nearly doubled. The growth rate of our emissions is rising fast, and it is rising even faster than we thought it was the worst case scenario just a few years ago, so yes it is right for me to be scared and terrified, and do something about it.
Greta Thunberg, at the age of 15, realized the lapse in what several climate experts were saying and in the actions that were being taken in society. The difference was so drastic in her opinion that she decided to take matters into her own hands.
*My goal and the goal of us all must be:*
1.	Stimulate a dialogue on progress & technology - good? Bad? How can we tell?
2.	Communicate the climate crisis to the younger generation
3.	Involve today's generation in tomorrow's decision-making process
*Danger!* - Climate change is a real and inevitable danger to all of humanity. The effects of climate change are already evident and could be tragic, if we do not act now!
Through education, innovation and adherence to our responsibilities, the citizens, both adults and young people, we may be able to make the necessary changes to protect the continued existence of the human race.
The main thought for today: *"The climate crisis is also my challenge"*

3. *Change Angels* - Today's mission and before the end of this challenge is to open your own * Challenge 18 Sustainability & Leadership group*. 💝This group does not require many members, even 3 people are enough, although the more people there are the more powerful the energy in my eyes.
Every day, you will have the task of passing the instructions from the day to the end of the 18 days, just as you received them and will continue to receive them from me.
You can use the previous messages I sent. Mark it with 🤹🏻‍♂‍🥇⌛

Remember that you will need to send the message and exercises of the notebook every day, and follow the people in your group who did the tasks (or take out of the group) - practice giving.

*Welcome to the fourteenth day of the challenge - LIFE UNDERWATER*
Goal number 14 deals with the conservation of the oceans, seas and underwater life.
Today, more than half of the world's coral reefs are in danger of extinction. Oceans face the threat of marine and nutritional pollution, resource depletion and climate change, all of which are a result primarily of human actions and the consequences are coming to us as well. These create global socio-economic problems, including health, safety and economic risks.
Is it our responsibility to make sure that world leaders do their job faithfully to protect marine animals?
Is it our responsibility to support people who depend on the oceans, whether the dependence is on employment, resources or pleasure?

The main thought for today is, *“Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish.”*

*Welcome to the fifteenth day of the challenge - life on land*
*Goal 15 - Protecting land ecosystems, restoring and promoting their sustainable use, sustainable forest management, fight against desertification, stopping and reversing land degradation, stopping the loss of biodiversity.*
We live in the midst of an age of species extinction, mostly man-made. If the current trends continue, about half of the species living today are expected to become extinct by the end of the century. Most extinct species are not known and therefore we do not know how their extinction will affect us. Renowned ecologist Paul Ehrlich likens this situation to passengers on a plane who disassemble screws in different parts of the plane while flying. The screw may attach the backrest to the seat, but it is also possible that disassembling the screw will impair engine operation. Just as there are many screws in the plane, so there are many species of living things on Earth and we have no way of predicting what the consequences of their extinction will be. What we do know is that we are destroying parts of the life-supporting systems on Earth, since life itself is what creates the life-supporting conditions of our planet.
Should we preserve a rainforest just because of the economic value of the drugs, and the potential food species hiding among its branches? Should we preserve the forest because it is part of the Earth's life support systems? And maybe the answer lies in our cultural values? How easily do we allow ourselves to ignore all the beauty and grandeur of nature? Do we really want to live in a world that is all artificial? What are the implications of such a situation for the mental well-being of human beings?
The main thought for today: *“Man is as the tree in the field - as the tree he strives up"*

*Welcome to the sixteenth day of the challenge 💖💖 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions*
Goal 16 reminds us that compassion and a strong moral compass are essential to any human democratic society. Persecution of the weak, corruption, injustice and abuse are still rampant and tearing apart the fabric of civilization. As hard as it is to admit, no country on earth exists in a true democracy. People have the illusion of choice and are actually managed and unrepresented. As long as it is a system run by humans there will always be corruption and injustice, it is time to advance legislation to integrate advanced technologies as part of the system of government. We must ensure that we have strong institutions, global standards of justice and a commitment to peace everywhere.
Choose one of three, no matter what the main thing is that you will feel comfortable and committed and connected to the process.

1. *Watch the TED talk* - Jody Williams: A realistic vision for world peace | & reflect on what you saw.  I invite you to contact members of the challenge group whose phone number ends with the same number as yours and discuss with them the issue of social justice - cool?
https://youtu.be/FD6CqD1kV8s

2. *Looking Back* - Look back at your task notebook and read all the tasks you have performed. Check to see if you have any gaps in the challenges or anything to add.

3. *Sophie's song* - see the following text message
Read the story you will find below at least two or three times and then write down your personal reflections and thoughts in a notebook.
And even better - share the group if you want🌹🌹🌹 everything that comes to your mind to write that fits the spirit of things.

*Sophie's Song*
Sophie was 😨. She woke up 😭 from her dream.
So she packed her  👜and set out on a journey to see the🌍 ,
She first met a puppy 🐕; He asked for 💧 so she shared her 💧,
She met a 🧍‍♂️ who was hungry, so she shared her 🍌,
She met a 🐤 that had fallen from the 🌳. So she took off her 👟 and made a 🏠 for the 🐤,
She met an 👴🏼 who was cold 🥶 so she gave him her 🧥,
She met a lost 🐑 who was crying so she sang her a happy 😁🎶🎵🎶 song,
When it started to 🌧, she was sitting under a 🌳, she was thirsty, hungry, she was cold 🥶 and she only had one 👟, but she was no longer 😨. Sophie fell asleep  😴.
She woke up with a 😀. Sophie was 😁.

Sophie's emotional journey consists of three stages: Fear -> Empathy -> Happiness. Symbolic release of the human spirit from darkness to light.
Task: Choose a person you think is unhappy / unwell, who has been complaining about life for some time and share Sophie's story with that person.
Then, write in a notebook: How was the sharing experience and what did it evoke in you? Did he / she answer you? Did you talk and how? Did the person thank you? How did sharing make you feel?
The main thought for today: *Justice-Justice will pursue*
A magical evening full of sustainability, leadership, peace, justice, strong institutions and passing on the good 💕

*Welcome to the seventeenth day of the challenge – Partnership for the Goals*
*So what does collaboration mean?* The true meaning of collaboration is the joint performance of actions that connect us to a new significant abundance in places where it was not previously visible and could not be revealed when each party acted alone.
*This is a real crisis* and should be addressed accordingly and we must work to reduce the use of consumable energy sources and do one hand in resolving the climate crisis. If we want to survive on Earth we have about a decade, until 2030, to completely change what and how we teach in schools, consume energy, sustain agriculture, run water, talk to our neighbors and more. This is not a passing trend, but a global change in the way we teach, in the way we do business, in social and corporate responsibility, and long-term thinking.
*"We have ten years to repair the damage we have caused and prevent a climate crisis"*, the UN warns.
The main thought for today: *"If you want to go fast - go alone*
*If you want to get far - go together"*

*Welcome to the 18th Day of the Challenge – For the FUTURE OF HUMANITY*
A lovely week to all of you all and thank you for persevering and succeeding on this amazing journey. I sincerely hope that you will continue to challenge yourself and that you will also lead many others to sustainability and leadership.
True, as you understand, it was just a quick and sweet tasting, a trailer for a movie called Life, in which we are not only the viewers but also the actors, who are looking for meaning, growth for achievements and a better world for all of us.

This is your year. Ask, declare, listen, smile more, start living, and see how you manage to grow each day with the choices and decisions you make, the way you spend your time, the people you hang out with and how you feel at any given moment.
For me, sustainability is first and foremost listening to the inner self, heart and mind, for me sustainability is living in the beings I have chosen for myself, joy, giving and listening, it all comes down to that.
I want to thank you again for participating in the challenge,
We are almost done ... another step and we reached the depths of this small and big journey.
In fact let's walk 18 festive steps, a reminder of our joint journey together. Imagine what kind of world you would like to live in? I would love to hear that in the group or in private,
You may say I'm dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope one day you will join me
And the world will be as one

How fun it is to be here. You are amazing! I'm happy and I congratulate you.
*The task for today* - Send this group a video or written message, preferably a video.
Introduce yourself, most of you do not know each other and it will be exciting to know who was part of the energy that supported us all.
Describe your experience from these 18 days of sustainability and leadership: emotions, observations, signs, surprises, what has changed inside and outside of you and so on.
If you want to resonate something in the universe this is the time!
If you have interesting ideas and projects share them here, this is important because this group may have people who are interested in what you do, the services you offer or your ideas.
Be creative and real when you describe yourself, do not be ashamed, the stage is all yours.
So I hope you enjoyed, I definitely feel privileged to go this way with you and I really enjoyed and grew, and I would love to see as many videos of you as possible or hear from you in writing about your experience, and even more, to hear that you have opened your own Challenge 18 group.
Continue a magical week full of sustainability, leadership and passing on the good 💕🌸🐋🙏🌎🌻
